# 🖥️ IT Ticket Trend Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **IT support ticket data** to identify patterns, monitor resolution performance, and uncover recurring issues. The result is a **Power BI dashboard** that helps IT teams allocate resources more efficiently and reduce ticket resolution times.

## 🛠️ Approach (STAR Method)

### **Situation**
Recognized the need for a **comprehensive analytics dashboard** to track and optimize IT support operations by analyzing ticket data.

### **Task**
Analyze the data and develop a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize ticket trends, measure resolution times, and highlight recurring issues.

### **Action**
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Processed raw ticket data using Python (Pandas) for quality and consistency.
- **Data Modeling**: Built a **relational data model** in Power BI to link multiple tables and enable interactive analysis.
- **Custom Measures**: Created KPIs to track **average resolution time**, **ticket backlog**, and **category-wise performance**.
- **Visualization**: Designed interactive charts and dashboards to monitor ticket volumes, resolution performance, and recurring issues.

### **Result**
Delivered an interactive dashboard that:
- Provided **clear visibility** into ticket trends over time.
- Helped allocate resources more efficiently.
- Reduced average resolution time through better tracking of bottlenecks.
